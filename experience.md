# Work Experience

## Substitute Teacher, IFoLD; Cagliari — April 2004-July 2004
- Taught the basics of HTML to troubled teenagers age 14 - 19.
A tough and extremely formative experience

- Built a win-win situation both giving and gaining respect, despite the lots of communication and behavioural issues that made the previous teacher run away

- Saw the class through the final exams, with success
