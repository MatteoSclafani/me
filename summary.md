# Summary

Eclectic Web Developer with 15+ years work experience in software development. Specialized in UX research, design, implementation, and technical documentation.

I love creating things. My current tools of the trade are: pen and paper, Balsamiq Mockups, HTML & CSS, AngularJS.

My ideal work routine starts with constant research, analyzing the UX of everything from a parking meter to GitHubâ€™s home page, then comes the paper, and a low-fidelity mockup.

The mockup is then shared, feedback is quickly collected, processed, and merged in the design.

Finally, the best part: building & shipping!  
Give me Sublime Text and a Gruntfile, and let me do my thing.
