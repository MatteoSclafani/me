# Summary

I’m currently studying a Diploma in Software Development in Dublin Business School (DBS) due to graduate in July 2016. I’m a Computer Engineer  with Android development experience at internship level. Also have 3 years’ experience as Volunteer in LILT (Italian Onlus Against Cancer). I’m seeking a Junior or graduate role as a software developer, ideally as C# or Android developer as these are my stronger skills. I have an upper intermediate level of English, expecially in reading and writing.
